# 🚗 Road Accident Data Analysis Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of road accident data using an interactive Excel dashboard. The aim is to identify patterns, high-risk regions, and key contributing factors to road accidents. By transforming raw data into visual insights, this project supports data-driven decisions for improving road safety.

## 📊 Features

- **Interactive Filters** – Segment data by year, location, weather conditions, vehicle type, and more.
- **Time Trend Visualization** – Line or bar charts to show accident frequency over time.
- **Accident Severity Breakdown** – Understand how many accidents are minor, serious, or fatal.
- **Geographic Comparison** – Identify regions with the highest accident rates.
- **Driver Profile Analysis** *(if available)* – Examine how age, gender, or experience affect accident rates.

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Time Patterns**: Accidents spike during specific months and times of day — especially during weekends and rush hours.
2. **Location Risks**: Certain areas repeatedly show higher accident counts, indicating infrastructural issues or poor traffic control.
3. **Weather Impact**: Rainy and foggy conditions are linked to increased accident severity.
4. **Vehicle Involvement**: Two-wheelers and heavy vehicles are disproportionately involved in accidents.
5. **Human Factors**: Inattention, speeding, and fatigue are common behavioral contributors to crashes.

## ✅ Recommendations

- **Urban Planning**: Improve lighting, road signs, and traffic signals in high-risk zones.
- **Law Enforcement**: Increase monitoring and control in regions and times with high incident rates.
- **Weather Alerts**: Deploy real-time alerts and reduce speed limits during adverse weather.
- **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Target driver education programs around common causes like mobile phone use and speeding.
- **Policy Changes**: Consider regulations specific to commercial vehicles and stricter penalties for repeat offenders.
